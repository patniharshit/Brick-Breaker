 GLAD
 GLM

Linux - Dependencies: (alternative)
 FreeGLUT
 GLEW
 GLM

----------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
GLFW:
 - Install CMake
 - Obtain & Extract the GLFW source code from
   https://github.com/glfw/glfw/archive/master.zip
 - Compile with below commands
   $ cd glfw-master
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
   $ make && sudo make install

GLAD:
 - Go to http://glad.dav1d.de
 - Language: C/C++
   Specification: OpenGL
   gl: Version 4.5
   gles1: Version 1.0
   gles2: Version 3.2
   Profile: Core
   Select 'Add All' under extensions and click Generate.
 - Download the zip file generated.
 - Copy contents of include/ folder in the downloaded directory 
   to /usr/local/include/
 - src/glad.c should be always compiled along with your OpenGL 
   code

GLM:
 - Download the zip file from 
   https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.7.2
 - Unzip it and copy the folder glm/glm/ to /usr/local/include

Ubuntu users can also install these libraries using apt-get.
It is recommended to use GLFW+GLAD+GLM on all OSes.


FreeGLUT+GLEW+GLM can be used only on linux but not recommended.
Use apt-get to install FreeGLUT, libglew, glm on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------
Based on the your installation run the makefile in the GLFW or GLUT
If the system is linux then convert Makefile.linux to Makefile and run the make command

$mv Makefile.linux Makefile
$make
$./sample2D 

Similarly for mac

RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Targets randomly drop from the top of screen.
2. Some mirrors are placed in the path where laser rays can be reflected as per laws of reflection.
3. The player can control the angle and vertical position and firing of the canon and gets points for shooting the target (blue bricks) (+1 for each).
4. Any mistargeting would cost negative points(-1 for each).
5. Once you shoot a laser ray, the canon takes one second to recharge, and then only you can shoot again.
6. On the bottom of the screen there are two baskets to collect color specific bricks. 
7. Game is over if any of the black brick is collected in any of these two baskets.
8. Game is also over if more than 20 red-green bricks are mistargeted.
9. There is one special brick which when hit will award +5 points, also for next 15 seconds it makes laser non destroyable.

CONTROLS
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tilt Cannon Upward = d
Tilt Cannon Downward = a
Move Cannon Up = s
Move Cannon Down = d
Increase falling bricks speed = m
Decrease falling bricks speed = n
Move Red Bucket = ctrl + right, ctrl + left / Drag with mouse
Move Green Bucket = alt + right, alt + left / Drag with mouse
Shoot = space / LMB
Zoom = up, down / mousescroll
Panning = right, left / RMB
