###BRICK BREAKER
----------------

Made By- Harshit Patni

##RULES

* Targets randomly drop from the top of screen.
* Some mirrors are placed in the path where laser rays can be reflected as per laws of reflection.
* The player can control the angle and vertical position and firing of the canon and gets points for shooting the target (blue bricks) (+1 for each).
* Any mistargeting would cost negative points(-1 for each).
* Once you shoot a laser ray, the canon takes one second to recharge, and then only you can shoot again.
* On the bottom of the screen there are two baskets to collect color specific bricks. 
* Game is over if any of the black brick is collected in any of these two baskets.
* Game is also over if more than 20 red-green bricks are mistargeted.
* There is one special brick which when hit will award +5 points, also for next 15 seconds it makes laser non destroyable.
